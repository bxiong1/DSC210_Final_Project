# Project: Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
### Course: DSC 210: Numerical Linear Algebra for Data Science
### Instructor: Dr. Tsui-wei Weng

#### Instructions:

Approch 1(Full Appoarch):
* Download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Vw1p2L2liha-GqRiuXb_cub4Ruz83o1/view?usp=sharing), and save it in your Google Drive under [My Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).
* Clone ```Final_Project_final.ipynb``` from the Github Repository.
* Upload the notebook file on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* Run all cells.

Apporach 2(Faster Appoarch):
Since Spacy (the Natural Lanuage Preprocessing toolkit) is slow for preprocessing the data (takes around 30-40 mins to preprocess), if you are interested in a faster implementation on our results you can follow the instruction under here:

* Download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Vw1p2L2liha-GqRiuXb_cub4Ruz83o1/view?usp=sharing) and the preprocessed dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-MsJTm7dBclK9wBkjZql77FUCqf0prTi/view?usp=sharing), and save both of the dataset in your Google Drive under [My Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).
* Clone ```Final_Project_final.ipynb``` from the Github Repository.
* Upload the notebook file on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* Skip running the cell start from below:
